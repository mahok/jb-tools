# Mahok/JbTools

JbTools stands for JuiceboxTools and is my personal replacement for the [JuiceboxBuilder](http://juicebox.net/tour/juiceboxbuilder/) shipped with Juicebox, as Adobe AIR is no longer maintained for GNU/Linux and working from the command line is more convenient anyway.

## Requirements

PHP >= 5.3.3

## Installation instructions

1.) Either download or clone repository.
2.) Download composer.phar (see [composer/composer](https://github.com/composer/composer))
3.) Run ```php composer.phar install```

## Documentation
